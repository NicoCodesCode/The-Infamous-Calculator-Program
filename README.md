# Calculator Program  

Hi! This is **MY** calculator program. I know everyone has made one, so I had to create mine too! ðŸ˜Ž  
It uses the **Math.js** library for calculations. Since it's the first time I use a library, Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ve loaded the library correctly, so if you notice anything wrong, please let me know!  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Use npm to install the Math.js library**
3. **Run the program using Live Server**
4. **Perform all the basic calculations you want!**
